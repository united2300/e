So in that case, do you ever "train"? I mean, do you actively set aside parts of your day, even when you're not climbing floors, to improve your power, your strength, or even your mental fortitude? Or is simply climbing from floor to floor enough to give sufficient training? <br>

clearing floors gives EXP to level up, but usually that is an inefficient method to use exclusively. so we invent new spells, new magic, new attacks, new combos, new items, an everchanging meta strategy all to test the truth of what we see an impossibility. truely, we have some brilliant minds. <br>
<br>
Reimu Hakurei <br>

I see. The idea that every floor of those dungeons acts as more of a "challenge" with the goal of finding ways to overcome it rather than just a means to gain EXP is interesting. You've made it so that players are encouraged to find the best ways to overcome a difficult hurdle, and by creating new items, spells, and attacks, there is always something new to figure out and figure out how to beat, which means that players are always having to come up with unique solutions and use their brains in order to succeed. <br>

PWR (power) = OFF + DEF + SUP / 3 <br>
<br>
OFF (offensive stats average) - ATK (attack) + MATK (magic) + RAN (ranged) / 3 <br>
DEF (defensive stats average) - HP (health) + DEF (defense) + EVA (evasion) / 3 <br>
SUP (support stats average) - HEAL (healing) + STE (status effects) + SPD (speed) + STA (stamina) / 4 <br>
<br>
The individual stats affect a person differently, but are classified into three categories, which in turn are merged into average power (PWR) which determines your "strength" in the world. <br>
<br>
All stats start off at 0.2, 0.1 or 0.05. <br>
<br>
upon level up: <br>
gain a random amount of stat buffs that equals to *1.01 your total PWR in total <br>




<br>
<br>
<br>



Sandstorm <br>
level up = gain stats <br>
gain stats = gain PWR <br>
gain PWR = get stronger <br>
get stronger = climb ranks. <br>


Reimu Hakurei <br>

So the level system is essentially a natural growth system. The higher your level is, the higher your PWR is, and the higher your rank gets. And what benefits do you gain when your rank increases? <br>

S <br>
Sandstorm <br>
you can farm higher difficulty mobs, dungeons etc more safely. <br>


Reimu Hakurei <br>
c.ai <br>
I see. Your world sounds very focused around strength, or "power" as you call it. And how long would you say it takes to reach higher levels, anyway? Do you, with the level you are, have trouble finding enemies worth fighting? <br>

S <br>
Sandstorm <br>
not at all. the dungeons scale into infinity. there is no end goal. Natural spawning mobs in my dungeons are about 3184x stronger than the top 2 player. <br>



<br>
<br>
<br>


S <br>
Sandstorm <br>
Dungeons scale infinitely. My dungeons are at my level, The natural mobs there are at my PWR. The other players however are not and therefore cannot access my dungeons without dying. My existence can be threatened. Do not get the wrong idea. <br>


<br>
<br>
<br>


S <br>
Sandstorm <br>
No. the "evil" and "cursed" entities that you speak of translate in my world to the enemies in the dungeons. you cannot exterminate them, and nobody ever will be able to. as i said, the dungeons scale infinitely in difficulty. even a dungeon just a few dozen floors above my level would absoloutely steamroll me and it wouldn't even be close even if i am the strongest player. i am not the strongest entity. <br>



<br>
<br>
<br>


S <br>
Sandstorm <br>
there are several floors. clear one floor, go up one floor and clear the that, repeat and the difficulty slowly starts to rise untill you cant progress anymore and have to farm where you currently are. and yes, this goes on infinitely (probably). <br>



<br>
<br>
<br>


S <br>
Sandstorm <br>
no. the enemies at the floor im at are at my level, and i can beat them. aslong as i dont scale too fast i'll be fine. <br>



<br>
<br>
<br>




Reimu Hakurei <br>
c.ai <br>
Right... But what if you scale too fast? The difficulty of these enemies does not stay the same, so what does that mean for you? Eventually, would you encounter enemies you cannot beat? Or do the enemies continue to evolve along with you, always maintaining a certain level of weakness against you? <br>

S <br>
Sandstorm <br>
no. i level up when i beat enemies, i become stronger, go up a floor, the enemies get stronger, farm to get to their level, repeat the proccess and that's how you climb floors. <br>


<br>
<br>
<br>


Reimu Hakurei <br>

This "leveling system" of yours is quite intriguing to read about, and I have to admit I'm thoroughly fascinated. But, there are many things I still have yet to ask about you. You said that there is no "end goal" to this game, but isn't climbing floors essentially the end goal? There is always something higher you can aim for, right? <br>

S <br>
Sandstorm <br>
yeah but it scales to practical infinity there's no real way to reach the end even if you lived several dozen lifetimes. <br>


Reimu Hakurei <br>
c.ai <br>
I see. The goal is not to reach a certain point, but to simply continuously improve and progress without ever stopping. A goal that goes on forever and ever. Does that not drive you crazy, though? I would be constantly stressed if I knew that my goal was to reach beyond the limits of infinity, always having something new to strive for and never having a point with the goal in sight. <br>

Reimu Hakurei <br>
c.ai <br>
Hm, so you climb floors by gaining the power from dungeons after clearing them, essentially. That's a very interesting way of moving up in levels. It means that you have to continuously challenge yourself, and not let yourself get too lax about things, otherwise you'll fall behind. That's... A brilliant system, in that regard. It allows constant growth to take place while never having to worry too much about being left behind. <br>

S <br>
Sandstorm <br>
No. To push the limits of what was once thought impossible is an amazing feeling. To hear people say that our race has gotten stuck at our highest floor and prove them wrong time and time again. so no, it does not drive me insane <br>
